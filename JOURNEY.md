# My Journey into Machine Learning

I began Machine Learning in my second semester where I learnt Python, a few python libraries like Numpy, Pandas Matplotlib and Seaborn but at that time, I didn't have good understanding of these.

Before, this in my first semester, I had started Web Development and learnt HTML, CSS and JavaScript and I was also learning DSA in Java.

I later found interest in Machine Learning over Web dev and so I started Machine Learning from scratch.

### Learning Mathematics for ML

Initially I had a question like everybody starting ML would have and it was whether to learn math before starting to code ML models.
After a lot of reasearch, I figured out that its best to have a fundamental understanding of math topics like linear algebra, probability and statistics and calculus before starting to code and indetail understanding is not needed.

So, I learnt Linear Algebra and Calculus from Imperial College London's Youtube channel. It was easier to follow along the course because I had learnt these math topics as part of college course.

### Introduction to Machine Learning

After brushing my math fundamentals, I started Introduction to AI and ML on edureka's YouTube channel to get a brief idea of fundamentals of Machine Learning and its algorithms.

### Learning Python libraies on Jovian

I wanted to learn Pythton libraries and then I found out this website Jovian to learn Python and its libraries. 
This was helpful to some extent i.e getting an idea of what all functions are there in these libraries but really couldn't understand the approach to follow when using these libraries.

### Machine Learning Specialisation by Andrew NG 

Then I started the most popular course on Machine Learning, Machine Learning Specialisation by Andrew NG. This specialisation consisted of 3 courses and I completed them in a period of 4 months.
With these courses, I understood the building blocks of Machine Learning and understood many things in depth as follows:-

**Course 1** - I learnt about Machine Learning, Supervised Learning, Linear Regression, Mutliple Linear Regression and Classification using Logistic Regression.

**Course 2** - In  course 2, I learnt about Neural networks and it's working and architecture. I also learnt in detail about decision trees and random forests.

**Course 3** - In this course, I learnt about unsupervised learning, KNN algorithm , recommenders and reinforcement learning in detail.

### Data Science Handbook by 

In order to learn in detail about Pyhton libraries, I understood that I needed a book to understand and learn about them. So I started this book and learnt about libraries like IPython, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Scikit-learn. 
By now I had understanding of these libraries and how these are used while building ML models.
I completed this book within 2 months.

### Complete AI, ML and DS Bootcamp by ZTM 

While I was at the end of the book, I realised that I needed to build projects and it would be better if I had a course which includes building ML and DL projects.
So I purchased this course on Udemy and started from the next day. I understood every video from the beginning of the course and I also enjoyed learning from the course.
This course covered the Python libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn and Seaborn and also the approach we need to follow when we use these libraries and that we don't need to remember everything. When we want any function, we can search on google and use it which is a part of ML reasearch.
There are 3 projects in the course which explains throughly the workflow  we need to follow while building projects or while we approach any ML problem which is amazing.


During this journey, I took a lot of breaks and overall this journey is of approx 2 years. 
Currently I'm learning from the ZTM course and building a Dog Classification Project.
