# Projects

### **Predicting Nashik Weather**

The goal of this project is to predict the Weather condition of Nashik which is a multi-class classification problem.
- The classes are Sunny ‚òÄÔ∏è, Rainy üåßÔ∏è or partly cloudy day ‚òÅÔ∏è.
- In this project, I've imported the data, explored it and build a model and experiment with a few different hyperparameters.

### **Predicting age of Abalone**

The goal of this project is to predict the age of Abalone given features and this is a Regression problem.
- In this project, I've imported and explored the data and built few models and compared the performance of each
- I've also used Optuna to tune hyperparameters.

### **Heart disease prediction**

This project was built as a part of the ZTM course - "Complete AI, ML and DS Bootcamp".
- This is a Classification problem used to predict whether a patient has great disease or not using features.
- While building this project, I learnt the structure and process to follow to build any ML project.

### **Bulldozer Price Prediction**

This project was also built during the Complete AI, ML and DS Bootcamp course by ZTM.
- This is a Regression problem used to predict the price of Bulldozer using features.
- This project taught me the structure to handle any regression problem.

### Dog vision project

This project is also part of the course which is used to classify images of dogs into different classes.
- I'm currently learning Deep Learning and Neural Networks building this project.
